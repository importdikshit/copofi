Mama + Mr. Shah Side Project;

Hi Ishan,
 
It was good speaking with you just now.  As mentioned I have purchased the domains www.copofi.com and .co.uk via godaddy.  
I have also emailed you the two photos that should replace the two photos that we have on Launchrock.
 
In terms of what we ideally would like on the website is the following free fields that consumers can input data:
 
1) (required) Name
2) (required) Email
3) (required, numerical field only) Number of Properties
4) (required) Locations of Properties (drop down please start with England, Wales, Northern Ireland, Scotland at the top, after this you can go in alphabetical order.  When you get to the United States can you put state by state in alphabetical order and then carry on through to the end).
5) (not required) Comments  - free field with maybe 500 characters.
 
In the top right somewhere can you add a drop down for language selection (similar to https://www.student.com/)?   
Having all the major European languages would be amazing. If its easy to add others with ease then please add those also.
 
The front end feel from a user perspective on the launch rock website is very good.  
if you could replicate something similar that would be fantastic.
At the back end launchrock uses KIWIK to get a huge amount of analytics.  If you can replicate something similar that would be great, but if its easier to simply pay and a plugging with kiwik then lets do that.  
 
If there are some enhancements that you want to do then feel free to do them if they don't take up too much time. 
We really appreciate your help on this. If you have any questions then please let me know on email/WhatsApp.
 
Regards,
Manish
